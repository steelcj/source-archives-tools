### Context

Work continued on SAT immediately following the conceptual milestone of “1.0.0”. During this session, it became clear that although a stable contract had emerged, **version governance had not yet been formally enforced**, and experimental development was still occurring on paths that would normally be reserved for stable releases.

This realization triggered a pause and a shift from feature work to **process correction and repository safety**.

---

### What Happened

- Reviewed SAT versioning semantics and clarified:
  - the meaning of `1.0.0` as a user-facing contract
  - the difference between stable guarantees and experimental work
- Drafted and finalized:
  - `VERSIONING.md`
  - `DEVELOPMENT_VERSIONING.md`
- Identified that experimental and unfinished features had been mixed into what conceptually felt like “1.0.0” work
- Audited Git tags and confirmed:
  - no `v1.0.0` tag exists yet
  - all existing tags are pre-1.0 (`v0.x.x`) or non-semver markers
- Created a **rescue branch** to preserve all in-progress work:
  - `rescue/experimental-2026-01`
- Committed all current experimental changes to the rescue branch
- Pushed the rescue branch to `origin` and set upstream tracking

At no point was `main` rewritten or force-pushed.

---

### Outcome

- All experimental work is **safely preserved**, locally and remotely
- `main` remains clean and suitable for defining a true `v1.0.0` baseline
- No published version promises were violated
- The repository is now in a state where:
  - stabilization can happen deliberately
  - version tagging can be done with confidence
  - experimental work can be reintroduced intentionally

---

### Key Insight

SAT crossed a threshold from “active development” into **contract-governed software**.  
The issue was not a technical mistake, but a missing layer of explicit governance — which has now been addressed.

This was a **timely correction**, made before any irreversible public release.

---

### Next Steps (Deferred)

- Define the exact scope of the `v1.0.0` contract
- Clean or gate experimental features
- Create or realign a proper `dev` branch
- Tag `v1.0.0` once the baseline is explicit
- Draft a short roadmap mapping experiments to future versions

No action required immediately.
