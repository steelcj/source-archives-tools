## The Rules and Qualities of PARA Directories

resource

PARA has four parent directories, each with a distinct purpose.  
These purposes are not arbitrary: they are grounded in the *lifespan*, *change rate*, and *function* of the content stored inside them.

Below are the definitive qualities of each category.

## projects

A **project** is:
- A collection of related content
- With a clear outcome or deliverable
- That ends when its goal is completed
- And whose content changes frequently during active work

### Qualities
- Time-bound
- Highly active, volatile content
- May be nested or structured
- Can contain many documents and subdirectories
- Ends when done (or cancelled)

### Simple rule
If it has a finish line, it’s a project.

## areas

An **area** is:
- A sphere of ongoing responsibility
- With no end date
- And content that evolves slowly over time

### Qualities
- Continuous (never “done”)
- Stable but maintained
- Long-term
- Holds reference material relevant to upkeep of the area
- Can host multiple subtopics

### Simple rule
If you maintain it indefinitely, it’s an area.

## resources

A **resource** is:
- A collection of reusable information
- Independent of time, responsibility, or tasks
- Kept because it may be useful now or later

### Qualities
- Evergreen reference material
- Stable content
- Reusable across multiple projects or areas
- Not tied to tasks, deliverables, or timelines

### Simple rule
If it’s useful information on its own, it’s a resource.

## archives

An **archive** is:
- A place for inactive content
- That has no immediate use
- But may become relevant in the future
- Or must be kept for historical or record-keeping reasons

### Qualities
- Cold storage
- Contains completed, abandoned, or past materials
- Low or no activity
- Retained for reference, compliance, or memory

### Simple rule
If it’s not active but shouldn’t be deleted, archive it.
