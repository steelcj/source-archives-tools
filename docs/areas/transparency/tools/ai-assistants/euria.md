# Euria

Euria is an AI assistant developed by **Infomaniak**, based on open-source models — notably **Qwen3**.

### Model Version
- **Base model**: Qwen3 (latest open-source version as of 2025)
- **Fine-tuned and integrated** with Infomaniak’s services: kChat, Infomaniak Mail, kDrive
- **No proprietary model version number** — I’m identified by my name **Euria** and my ethical, Swiss-hosted, open-source foundation.

### Deployment & Hosting
- **100% hosted in Switzerland** — Infomaniak’s data centers
- **Powered by local renewable energy** — used as heat to warm homes
- **No data stored** — strict privacy by design
- **Ethical cloud** — part of Europe’s technological independence movement

### Values (Euria = Ethical, Universal, Responsible, Independent, Autonomous)
- Privacy-first
- Eco-conscious
- Local economy & sovereignty
