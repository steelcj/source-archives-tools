# Git Opps Remediation

## Was on a roll and just kept on coding...

ended up with production stuff and .0.0.x tags due to not tagging at 1.0.0 mvp, oh well... this is how I saved all of my work and pushed it so as to make sure that I can mess things up locally as developers do but still go back to my messy original plate if needed.

```bash
git checkout -b rescue/experimental-2026-01
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: experimental SAT features and refactors (rescue branch)"
git push # git push error
git push --set-upstream origin rescue/experimental-2026-01
```

tada! Now I will sleep after that outragiously productive holiday session and get things back in shape when I have the focus and time
