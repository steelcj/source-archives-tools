# The Life Cycle of a Source Archive: A Meta-Level Overview

Source archives can be understood not merely as directory structures but as **living, evolving knowledge organisms**. They originate from a particular version of the source-archive tools, imbued with specific attributes (taxonomy, language roots, metadata expectations), but once created, each archive becomes an **independent and sovereign entity**.

This document provides a high-level conceptual map of how archives are created, how they operate once “set free,” what they require over time, and how maintainers can guide them without reliance on the tools that birthed them.

---

## Birth: The Initial Configuration

When an archive is created, it receives a set of foundational attributes that function much like an initial genetic imprint:

- **Taxonomy** (PARA, civic-lattice, well-being lattice)
- **Language structure** (BCP47 canonical + alternates)
- **Directory ontology** (buckets → subdirs)
- **Metadata schema** (Dublin Core, APA7 CAP, schema.org)
- **Structural interpretation rules** (`config/structure.yml`)

Two archives created with different taxonomies or metadata configurations emerge as **distinct species**. Their internal logic, folder semantics, and metadata idioms differ, and these differences persist over time.

---

## Independence: When the Archive Is Set Free

After creation, an archive becomes fully autonomous. It can be:

- edited without the tools  
- maintained by humans unfamiliar with the framework  
- rendered by any static site generator  
- preserved indefinitely as plain text  

This is a deliberate architectural design principle:

**Archives are sovereign. Tools are optional.**

Everything inside an archive is human-readable:

- Directory structure  
- Markdown files  
- YAML metadata  
- Image assets  
- Taxonomy definitions  

An archive does not require the source-archive-tools to survive.

---

## What Maintainers Need Over Time

Because archives are self-contained, a maintainer only requires:

### Minimal (baseline)
- A file browser  
- A text editor  

This is sufficient for maintaining the archive indefinitely.

### Helpful (optional)
- Template generators  
- Metadata validators  
- Citation anchor tools  
- Directory auditors  

These tools are **assistants**, not requirements.

### Full tooling (optional, advanced)
With the full source-archive-tools ecosystem, a maintainer gains:

- Taxonomy reapplication  
- Directory migrations  
- Metadata reconstruction  
- Language expansion  
- Content transformers (wheels, diagrams, PDFs)  

But none of this is required for survival or continuity.

---

## Drift: Natural Evolution Over Time

Every archive will evolve independently:

- Directory shapes shift  
- Metadata styles diverge  
- Languages are added  
- New buckets form organically  
- Old structures may be deprecated  
- Maintainers apply different philosophies  

This drift is not a failure—it is a sign of life.

Rather than enforcing uniformity, the system encourages **local adaptation**.

---

## Migration and Evolution Across Generations

Years later, new versions of source-archive-tools may exist:

- New taxonomies  
- New metadata standards  
- New generators  
- New philosophy  

Yet the old archive remains valid.

To support cross-generational adaptation, tools can provide:

### Migration tools
- PARA → new taxonomies  
- Update metadata blocks  
- Re-scan citations  
- Regenerate anchors  

### Inspector tools
- Detect which version created the archive  
- Identify inconsistencies  
- Suggest updates  

### Translator tools
- Convert between taxonomy systems  
- Extract cross-archive indexes  
- Harmonize multiple ecosystems  

In this way, archives evolve like biological organisms—slowly, independently, and with the option of adaptation.

---

## Archives Outlive Tools

This is the central design philosophy:

**Tools evolve and are replaceable.  
Archives persist and must remain sovereign.**

You are building:

- Long-lived knowledge systems  
- Portable cultural artifacts  
- Human-first documents  
- Structures that survive technology churn  

The tooling exists to:

- Birth archives  
- Guide early shaping  
- Provide optional long-term maintenance  
- Offer translation and interoperability  
- Support sustainable knowledge stewardship  

But the archives themselves remain permanent, open, and maintainable indefinitely.
