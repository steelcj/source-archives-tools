* resource

### What is the intended *usage pattern* of this document?
Is the document meant to live alongside other files that form a multi-file body of work, or does it stand alone?

### Will this document be expanded with related files over time?
Do you expect to add more documents, directories, or assets around it in the future?

### Is this document part of a group of materials you will actively maintain?
Will the document be updated regularly or used as a base for further work?

### Is this document meant to act as a reference or reusable material?
Do you want this document to be physically located where stable, reusable, or supportive materials usually live?

### Does this document belong to a collection representing earlier versions or historical information?
Is the document meant to capture something from the past, or something that has been replaced, superseded, or set aside?

### Will this document serve as the root of a new directory tree?
Does the document require its own content_root with subdirectories beneath it?

### Is there already an existing PARA directory whose structure this document naturally fits into?
Does an existing directory physically resemble where this document wants to go?

### Should this document be grouped with other documents that share a similar lifecycle?
Does this document follow the same pattern of revision, growth, or archival as another directory in your PARA tree?
