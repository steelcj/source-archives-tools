# User Stories for Data-Driven Archive Behavior  
## Quick Capture Template (Exploratory)

This template is designed for **rapid, low-friction capture** of user stories during the Data-Driven Archive Behavior MVP phase.

It intentionally avoids implementation detail, tooling assumptions, and premature constraints.  
Each section includes a short description highlighting the *long-form story elements* it implicitly covers.

---

## As a …

**Context · Role · Situation**

Describe **who** the user is and **the situation they are in**.  
This implicitly captures the *Context* and *Perspective* from a longer user story without requiring formal structure.

> mary has some loosely organized content for a website she is making. It is in P.A.R.A. subdirectories. She knows that she wants to have some content moved from resources/terrible-directory-name to resources/great-name but other items need to go somewhere else but she is not yet sure where so she includes resources/great-name in her definition but nothing else.

---

## I want to …

**Goal · Action · Intent**

Describe **what the user wants to accomplish**, focusing on outcomes rather than steps.  
This implicitly captures the *Goal* and *High-level Action* of the story.

> She would love to review the unorganized documents, perhaps adding metadata could help her revisit the content.
>
> She might want to start with document titles

---

## So that …

**Motivation · Value · Expected Outcome**

Describe **why this matters** and **what success looks like to a human**.  
This implicitly captures *Motivation*, *Expected Outcome*, and *Value*.

> *So that she can do a great organization job

## Notes (Optional)

Use this space for:
- uncertainties
- assumptions
- tensions
- things that feel unclear or worth revisiting

These notes are signals, not problems to solve immediately.

---

## Guidance

- Keep stories **short and human-readable**
- Avoid commands, flags, or implementation language
- Treat stories as **learning tools**, not commitments
- Revise freely as understanding improves

A good story at this stage clarifies *intent*, not *design*.

---

## Summary

This quick capture format supports the exploratory nature of the Data-Driven Archive Behavior MVP by:

- lowering the cost of writing user stories
- keeping humans and intent central
- allowing real use cases to surface design pressure naturally

Stories written with this template should help guide what the system needs to *reveal*, not what it must *automate*.
