# SAT Markdown Style and Generation Rules

## Headings
- Always use Markdown heading markers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- Never bold headings
- Never number headings
- Headings must remain plain text without decorative characters or formatting

## General Markdown
- Avoid using bold text for structural or semantic meaning
- Use bold only for light emphasis within sentences
- Keep sections clean, compact, and minimal
- Use unordered lists consistently (choose `-` or `*` and remain consistent within a section)
- Preserve indentation, spacing, and the visual layout of examples
- Avoid horizontal rules (`---`) except when used as YAML metadata delimiters in full documents

## Content Writing Rules
- Focus strictly on physical structure unless otherwise stated
- Use a vocabulary-first approach to introduce new concepts
- Avoid introducing semantics, metadata behavior, or generator assumptions
- Do not rely on specific tools or frameworks unless explicitly required
- Ensure all examples reflect long-term maintainability and stable archival practices
