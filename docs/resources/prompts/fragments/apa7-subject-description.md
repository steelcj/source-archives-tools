- Maintain disciplinary accuracy and contextual clarity.
- Use citations only where factual claims, definitions, or formulations depend on sources.

### Purpose
This section exists to:
- Define and contextualize a subject
- Summarize established knowledge

### Citation Rules (APA 7)
- Use **APA-style parenthetical citations** for sourced claims:
  - Example: `[(Author, Year)](#author-year-reference)`
- Insert a **CAP citation anchor** (`{apa-id}-citation`) at the point of textual dependence.
- Quotes are optional; include them only when they provide canonical wording or definitional clarity.
- Ensure each citation has a corresponding entry in the References section.

### Tone
- Academic
- Descriptive
- Neutral
- Non-interpretive

End the section without summary or conclusion unless explicitly requested.
