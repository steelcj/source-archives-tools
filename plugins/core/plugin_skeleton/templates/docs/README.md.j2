# README.md

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the **{{ plugin_name }}** plugin for the SAT system. It explains the plugin’s purpose, category, entrypoints, internal structure, and integration points within the SAT tooling ecosystem.

The plugin follows SAT’s core rules for determinism, non-generative behavior, accessibility, and metadata alignment. All SAT plugins must adhere to the standardized directory layout and manifest structure defined by the SAT Plugin Skeleton Tool.

### Plugin Name
`{{ plugin_name }}`

### Category
`{{ plugin_category }}`  
Valid categories include: `core`, `metadata`, `taxonomy`, `style`, `structure`, `language`, and `other`.

### Description
{{ plugin_description }}

### Entrypoints

The plugin defines the following entrypoints in `plugin.yml`:

```
{{ plugin_entrypoints }}
```

Each entrypoint corresponds to an operation that SAT tooling may invoke.  
Entrypoints must be deterministic, must not generate content, and must not depend on external network access.

### Directory Layout

A SAT-compliant plugin created from the skeleton tool uses the following structure:

```
plugin_name/
  plugin.yml
  docs/
    README.md
  defaults/
  examples/
  tests/
  python/              (optional)
    plugin_name/
      __init__.py
      validators.py
  validators/          (optional)
  bin/                 (optional)
```

The plugin must preserve this structure even as additional capabilities are added.

### Manifest Requirements

Every SAT plugin must include a `plugin.yml` manifest containing:

- `id`
- `name`
- `version`
- `description`
- `category`
- `paths`
- `entrypoints`

The Plugin Skeleton Tool validates the manifest for completeness and structural correctness.

### Determinism and Safety Requirements

All SAT plugins must follow the SAT core safety constraints:

- deterministic execution  
- no network access  
- no randomization  
- no content generation or rewriting  
- no modification of human-authored meaning  
- clear, auditable behavior  

Plugins may manipulate metadata, file structure, validation flow, or formatting rules, but may not alter the meaning of SAT documents.
