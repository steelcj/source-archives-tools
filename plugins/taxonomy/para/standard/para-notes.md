# PARA Taxonomy Notes

This directory contains conceptual notes and references for the PARA taxonomy.

- **Projects**: time-bound, outcome-oriented efforts  
- **Areas**: ongoing responsibilities and domains of attention  
- **Resources**: reference material and reusable assets  
- **Archives**: completed, inactive, or deprecated material  

The mapping of PARA concepts into concrete paths is defined in
`../config/default.yml`. Archive-local taxonomy files may extend or override these defaults.
