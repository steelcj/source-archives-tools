# Dublin Core Custom Metadata Profile Test

This document is used to verify that the Dublin Core plugin respects custom metadata overrides when a custom profile is applied.

It ensures that:

- Custom Creator values override defaults
- Custom Language settings are preserved
- Explicitly provided fields are not overwritten by defaults
