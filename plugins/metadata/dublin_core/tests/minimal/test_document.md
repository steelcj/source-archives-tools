# Minimal Dublin Core Test

This is a minimal Markdown document used to test how the Dublin Core metadata plugin behaves when no metadata is present.

The goal of this file is to verify:

- The plugin can detect missing metadata.
- Default values are applied correctly.
- Required Dublin Core fields (Title, Creator, Language, License) are filled in.
- The transformation does not modify the document body unexpectedly.
