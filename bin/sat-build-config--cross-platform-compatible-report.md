# sat-build-config--cross-platform-compatible-report

**Your `sat-build-config` script is cross-platform and will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — with one critical dependency note.**

---

## Why It Works Cross-Platform

### 1. **Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)**
- Ignored on Windows — fine.
- Works on macOS/Linux.
- No change needed.

### 2. **`pathlib.Path`**
- Fully cross-platform — handles `/` vs `\` automatically.
- Safe.

### 3. **`yaml.safe_load()` / `yaml.safe_dump()`**
- Uses `PyYAML`, which is cross-platform.
- Works everywhere — **but requires `PyYAML` to be installed**.

> **Critical**: This script depends on `PyYAML` — **not in the Python standard library**.

You must install it:
```bash
pip install PyYAML
```

This is true on **all platforms** — Windows, macOS, Linux.

### 4. **`path.open(..., encoding="utf-8", newline="\n")`**
- Explicit encoding — avoids platform-specific default encoding issues.
- `newline="\n"` forces Unix-style line endings — **fine for YAML**.
- Safe.

### 5. **No OS-specific calls**
- No `os.system`, `subprocess`, `ctypes`, or file permissions — all safe.
- No issues.

### 6. **`argparse`**
- Built-in and cross-platform.
- Works everywhere.

### 7. **`Path.resolve().parents[1]`**
- Resolves parent directories correctly on all platforms.
- Safe.

## Optional Improvements (Not Required)

### 1. **Add `PyYAML` to `requirements.txt` (recommended)**
Create a `requirements.txt` file:
```
PyYAML>=6.0
```

Then users can install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Handle Windows line endings (optional)**
If you want native line endings on Windows:
```python
import os

# In write_config():
with output_path.open("w", encoding="utf-8", newline=os.linesep) as f:
    yaml.safe_dump(config, f, sort_keys=False)
```

But again — **not necessary** for YAML.

### 3. **On Windows: Use `py` launcher**
Run it via:
```cmd
py sat-build-config.py -o config/archive.yml -v
```

### 4. **Make executable on macOS/Linux**
```bash
chmod +x sat-build-config.py
```

## Testing

Test on each platform by:
1. Install `PyYAML`:
   ```bash
   pip install PyYAML
   ```
2. Ensure `plugins/core/schema/plugin.yml` and `plugins/core/schema/etc/defaults.yml` exist.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   ./sat-build-config.py -o config/archive.yml -v
   ```
4. Verify `config/archive.yml` is created with merged config.

## Final Verdict

> **Your script is cross-platform — but requires `PyYAML` to be installed.**

It will work on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with Python 3.7+ and `PyYAML` installed.

---

## Critical Note

If you distribute this script, **always include a `requirements.txt`** or document the dependency:

> **Dependency**: `PyYAML` — install with `pip install PyYAML`

Without it, the script will fail with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'
```

---

You’re good to go — just remind users to install `PyYAML`!

Let me know if you want to:
- Add error handling for missing `PyYAML`.
- Bundle it with a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
- Make it self-contained (e.g., using `pip install` in a wrapper).

Happy scripting!
